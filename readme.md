Excercises to learn Artemis
==============

You need to install ActiveMQ and set up with
admin:abc123

I like to install in ~/lib

You can now start the broker by executing:  

   "/~/lib/mybroker/bin/artemis" run

Or you can run the broker in the background using:

   "~/lib/mybroker/bin/artemis-service" start


Part one

there is a client and a server

npm init in each directory
node index.js the client first then the summary


This is very terse
I will replace with stomp-it
